### song_recommender

This project is designed to share new music between groups of frinds that use Spotify. 

The first step is to collect databases of the listened songs through spotify webside. Each list is processed with the library Spotipy, though the library, a profile of each user is done by evaluating the artists and the different kinds of music listened. 

Finally, when one user want to have a recommendation, its own profile matches with similar profiles between the group of fiends, and a list of 10 probably likable songs are provided
